## About Bamboo

Bamboo is a task management app created for my solo capstone with [Epicode Global](https://epicode.com/) (formerly known as Strive). Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with a backend powered by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack), Bamboo has the following cool features:-
* Create, Delete and Update User Profile
* Login and Register with session-stored JWT
* Search for other users and request, accept or reject them as Teammates
* Create, Update or Delete Tasks with XP, Category, Title, Description (optional) and Deadline (optional)
* Create Shared or Repeated Tasks
* Create Categories with chosen color
* Buy XP Badges and display them on your Profile
* Gift XP to Teammates
* Filter Tasks by Type, Deadline, Status or Shared
* View own and Teammates' Achievements
* Get Notifications
* Admins have special page to filter and view Users and Tasks

Future deployments will also feature:-
* Edit, Update and Delete Categories
* Full CRUD capabilities at front-end for Admins
* Users register with Team Leaders' join-up link, giving TL administrative control
